# CI/CD Agnostic Testing Framework
Built on python and sh, this framework aims to divorce the testing environment and control for running regression tests from the CI/CD tools (Github Workflows, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, etc.) allowing for portable usage. Likewise as this can exist outside those tools, the testing framework allows configuration for running tests in either a complex job-submission style HPC system or a local run, better allowing debugging of failing tests beyond logs available from said tools. The added benefit in this is immense as the local tests will replicate the CI/CD build as close as possible with differences only arising from changes in user-CI/CD environment and any job parallelization done.
