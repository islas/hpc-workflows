We will be using common terminology found in the repo's README.md - refer to that for any underlined terms that need clarification.

Anything in `\"code-quoted\"` format refers specifically to the test config, and anything in <ins>underlined</ins> format refers to specific terminology that can be found in the [README.md](../README.md).\n"
