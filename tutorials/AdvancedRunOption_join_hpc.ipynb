    "## Joining Tests for Single HPC Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests can specify general resource usage and steps can further refine those requirements. This works well to individually submit each step independently to an HPC grid. However, for relatively small steps or if the smallest resource allocations are comparably large (e.g. whole node allocations for large core-count CPUs) one may want to aggregate the tests into larger workloads to be more effective with the resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be an appealing option if queue times on the grids are long, requiring individually submitted steps to each wait in the queue. Thus for steps with dependencies this would emulate re-entering the queue multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the need to over-spec the test suite to one particular machine (remember we want this to remain generic and flexible) the framework natively supports joining tests and steps into single job submissions. Tests and steps should now be able to remain as small logically separate components, steering away from machine-specific large and fragile multiple tests in one script designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Check the FQDN of the node if using host-specific selections!</b>\n",
    "When using cummulative join features for HPC runs the host that actually runs the final individual step is actually the HPC node and not the login node from which the command was launched. Joining tests under one HPC job bundles all the specified tests and their respective steps into one HPC launch step that then runs the tests normally in the node. This can at times lead to different FQDN naming between where the initial launch of the job and where the step is finally run, depending on how your computing system had been configured.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Final <ins>step argacks</ins> to the step only rely on the location where the step script is started (i.e. when \"Running command\" for that step is shown). This cah be affected by using the joining capabilities as the selected <ins>submit options</ins> may differ between where you launch and where it runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <ins>hpc argpacks</ins> required for the steps to be submitted to the grid, total aggregated via joining or submitted normally, will only ever rely on the host that starts the test suite (the HPC login node). They are never used in the node environment for the fully joined submission and thus are not affected by changes in FQDN.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ALTERNATIVELY** consider using the `--forceFQDN` option to manually specify the selection criteria\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where do resource amounts come from?\n",
    "Recall that each step in the end specifies its own individual set of `\"arguments\"` from its cummulative ancestry. The `\"hpc_arguments\"` work the same way as all keys under `\"submit_options\"` do. The difference here is that `\"hpc_arguments\"` is slightly more complex dictionary as opposed to a single dictionary of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "As HPC systems can be very different in scheduler args, format, and resources available to request one of the simplest approaches is to let the user specify the details as explained in the [Advanced Test Config - HPC argpacks](./AdvancedTestConfig_hpc_argpacks.ipynb) tutorial. This then provides a generally easy means to isolate resource amounts as the <ins>resource argpacks</ins> values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accepted Formats\n",
    "Internally, when steps and tests are joined for HPC submission values from <ins>resource argpacks</ins> are attempted to be joined and if unsuccessful the first value for that resource key is used. It's not a perfect solution but is easy to understand and works for the most part. Supported values that can be joined are :\n",
    "* integers\n",
    "* memory amount strings in the format `[0-9]+(t|g|m|k)?(b|w)` where `(t|g|m|k)` correspond to unit prefix multipliers and `(b|w)` to bytes or words as units, case insensitive - e.g. \"4GB\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Config\n",
    "To see this in action we will show one resource of each style in PBS-style :\n",
    "* nodes as integers\n",
    "* memory per node as memory string\n",
    "* job priority as non-joinable string \n",

    "That is used to tally the total maximum resources a test would use. As a pessimistic approximation, we use that maximum as what a test would use for its entire duration. From there the process pool is used to account for implicit execution order of tests, once again doing the same process of maximum resource usage but now based on the tests' allotments instead of steps. The final aggregation is what will be placed on the command line for the HPC submission command arguments.\n",

This would be difficult to automate, inquiring about all the potential combination of resources what nodes are at your disposal and their respective capabilities, and so on. It _could_ be done, but is beyond the scope and philosophy of this framework to remain simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "To override the final resource aggregation, we would pass in an argument to the `-j` flag in the format of the `\"hpc_arguments\"` `{}` dictionary that was accumulated. Recall that the joining aggregates your resultant `\"hpc_arguments\"` for each step (resolving all host-specifics and regex <ins>hpc argpacks</ins>) and then tests into one large set of <ins>hpc argpacks</ins>. Due to the uniqueness requirements of each plus the added output help of `From [<origin>] adding '<hpc argpack>'...From <origin> adding resource '<resource argpack>[ : <value if present> ]`, it should be possible to write an `\"hpc_arguments\"` `{}` that can index and override any resource value.\n",

If we look at the `[step::submit] Submitting step submit...Gathering HPC argument packs...` section, we see that the <ins>argpack</ins> names no longer have regexes in them. When joining, the <ins>argpack</ins> \"basename\" for <ins>hpc and resource argpacks</ins> is used to aggregate common entries. Furthermore, as we only care about the \"basename\" and many regex <ins>argpacks</ins> may be contributed from respective steps it makes no sense to track or use the original regexes as keys into our final joining `\"hpc_arguments\"` so instead it is simply stripped out. \n",

This might be better solved with a heterogeneous resource submission and further highlights where this feature breaks down, but let's continue with this less-efficient approach for completness. \n",
