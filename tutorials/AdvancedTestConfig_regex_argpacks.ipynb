    "\n",
    "The following section assumes you have a general understanding of regular expressions. For further reading please refer to :\n",
    "* [the wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Basic_concepts)\n",
    "* an excellent [open-source guide available in many languages](https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex)\n",
    "* a python-specific [`re` introduction](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto)\n",
    "* (something I personally find incredibly useful) an [online regex tester with in-depth explanations](https://regex101.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the `\"<regex>::\"`-style <ins>argpack</ins>, it is important to note a few things : \n",
    "1. The regex flavor used is python's `re` module\n",
    "2. The python if-check uses `re.match()` with no flags ([`re` flags](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#flags))\n",
    "3. __ALL__ inherited arguments are attempted to be applied only when steps begin execution\n",
    "4. The regex is applied to the full <ins>ancestry</ins>\n",
    "5. To override the regex-<ins>argpack</ins>, it must match wholly `\"<regex>::<argpack>\"`\n",
    "6. The `\"<argpack>\"` portion of `\"<regex>::<argpack>\"` is what is used to sort order\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (1) and (2), please refer to the `re` reference links. Simply put, (1) gives wide flexibility on the types of regex constructs that may be used and (2) means the regex is interpreted as literal as possible, i.e. case-sensitive, `^` and `$` only apply to beginning and end of string, and `.` does not match newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of (3) is that the cummulative set of arguments inherited in a <ins>step</ins>'s <ins>ancestry</ins> is always applied. When not using regex-<ins>argpack</ins>, one should be careful to only pass things down to appropriate steps. Thus, with the advantages of regex-based conditional application of <ins>argpacks</ins> it is possible to become lazy or sloppy in heavy reliance of this feature. This could be thought of akin to global variables in that solely relying on regexes to route arguments from the top-level `\"arguments\"` option pollutes the <ins>argpack</ins> namespace unnecessarily. Writing regexes is already complex enough, and having _all_ the regexes applied to _all_ <ins>steps</ins> but only needing them to apply to a few under a single specific <ins>test</ins> may be a disaster waiting to happen and easier solved by scoping the regex to just the <ins>test</ins>'s `\"argument\"` option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point (4) provides corollary to (3): because the regex is applied to the <ins>ancestry</ins>, to make maximal use of this greater flexibility in application of the arguments one should be mindful of test and step naming in conjunction with writing well-defined regexes. Keeping this in mind for a <ins>test config</ins>, one could devise specific naming conventions allowing for specific test or step filtering. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if I have a series of steps across multiple tests but all require a specific set of arguments when executing the \"build\" step of each test, I can extract the common build arguments and place them under a `\".*build.*::build_args\"` <ins>argpack</ins> if my \"build\" steps are prefixed with `\"build\"`. Furthermore, if my build steps across tests slightly differ based on compiler I can name my steps `\"build-gcc\"`, `\"build-icc\"`, `\"build-clang\"` and so on writing other <ins>argpacks</ins> such as `\".*-gcc.*::gcc_env\"` to load a specific environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, (5) and (6) are restatements from the [README.md](../README.md) \"How it works\"-><ins>Submit Options</ins> subsection. These matter when argument order or overriding an <ins>argpack</ins> is necessary. Generally speaking, if you find you need to often override an <ins>argpack</ins>, whether regex or not (but especially if regex) you are most likely overcomplicating things. Consider rescoping the arguments or moving them to specific `\"arguments\"` option inside a <ins>step</ins> (not the `\"submit_options\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple regex-<ins>argpack</ins> config\n",

    "Let's start with something small : a test with two types of steps - a sender and receiver - with prefixes `send` and `recv`. We'd like for each to identify themselves with a defined string before output.\n"
